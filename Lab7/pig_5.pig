 * Write a Pig Latin query that returns the number of tweets for each user name (not login). (local mode)
 *
 * As input it will read from two CSV files that contain descriptions about users and tweets, respectively.
 * Each line in the user collection contains: login, name and state from a specific user.
 * Each line in the collection of tweets has the tweet id, content, and a reference to the user who wrote that tweet.
 *
 * Output one user per line, in the following format:
 *     	user_name, number_of_tweets
